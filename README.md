# Surfs_up Analysis
# Overview
## Purpose:
* W. Avy, an investor, would like to open Surf n' Shake, a chain store selling surfing equipment and ice cream in Oahu, Hawaii.  In order to remain convinced about the investment, W. Avy requested a weather analysis with concentration on air temperatures for June and December.  Possible future business expansion to other islands in Hawaii will depend on the set up of this analysis as well.
